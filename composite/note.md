# Definition

Composite is a structure design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree
structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects

# Structure design pattern

# Problem
Using the Composite pattern makes sense only when the core model of your app can be
repsesented as a tree.

For example, imagine that you have two types of objects: Product and Boxes. A Box can
contain several Products as well as a number of smaller Boxes. These little Boxes can
also hold some Products or even smaller Boxes and so on.
